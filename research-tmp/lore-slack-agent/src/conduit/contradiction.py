"""Evidence-grounded timeline & contradiction resolver — Lore's core differentiator.

Why this module exists
----------------------
The demo money-shot ("we decided $10 in March … reversed to $20 in May … the
current answer is $20") must be *deterministic*, not a hope that the local model
phrases a reversal correctly. The earlier approach scraped contradictions out of
the LLM's already-written prose with a ``(\\w+)`` regex — which cannot even capture
``$10``/``$20`` (the ``$`` is a non-word char), so it silently missed the exact
example we demo. This module instead grounds the reasoning in the **evidence**:

  * order the evidence chronologically by Slack ``ts`` (unix seconds),
  * extract the concrete *value* each message asserts for the queried entity
    (currency, percentages, numbers, yes/no-style decisions),
  * detect when that value **changed over time**, and
  * surface the **current** (latest) value with a citation to its source.

It operates on any object exposing ``text``, ``ts``, ``channel`` and ``permalink``
(both :class:`conduit.rts_client.SearchHit` and :class:`conduit.research.Evidence`
qualify), so it is reusable across the pipeline and independent of the model.
