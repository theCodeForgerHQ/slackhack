/**
 * C5 — Multi-source truth reconciliation.
 *
 * The rules that matter:
 *   • PR merged          ≠ fulfilled
 *   • ticket Done        ≠ customer notified, and not enough to verify
 *   • deploy complete    ≠ customer confirmed
 *   • code merged + deployed to the customer's environment → AVAILABLE (Gate 2 may proceed)
 *   • customer confirms success → STRONG closure
 *
 * `sufficientForVerification` is what the INTERNALLY_VERIFIED guard consults: a
 * human may verify only when reconciled evidence actually proves availability.
 * The human still has to approve (approved_by) — evidence opens the gate; it
 * does not walk through it.
