# Kept

> **Elevator pitch:** Kept is a Slack-native, human-verified obligation ledger for shared customer channels that never treats a ticket status or a merged PR as truth — it **verifies reality** from proof it gathers itself, and closes the loop back in the original thread only after a human signs.

## The 15-second version (why this isn't another ticketer)

A Jira ticket flips to **Done**. Pylon, Thena, and ClearFeed would now surface it as fixed and let someone tell the customer.

Kept doesn't. It queries the **LaunchDarkly feature flag over MCP** — the flag gating that fix is **OFF in production**. The deploy never shipped. So Kept **blocks the close**, and shows the owner an **Evidence Packet**: ticket Done ✓, PR merged ✓, prod deploy ✓ — **feature flag OFF ✗ → not verifiably available**.

That single beat is the whole thesis. **Your ticketer tracks status. Kept verifies reality.** It's the exact failure mode — "false done" — that burns customer trust, and it's the one thing a status-tracking tool structurally cannot catch.

## The concept exists. Here's how Kept improves on it.

The Organizations judging question is *"does this already exist, and how much does this improve on it?"* — so we'll answer it head-on.

| | Pylon / Thena / ClearFeed | **Kept** |
|---|---|---|
| Unit of work | a ticket / conversation | a **first-class obligation** with its own lifecycle |
| "Done" means | a status field flipped | **proof reconciled** — flag ON + PR merged + prod deploy (or a customer confirmation) |
| Who acts | agent routes / auto-replies | **agent assembles proof; a human signs the verdict** |
| Customer safety | manual care | **audience sanitizer + leak detector on every customer-facing word, by construction** |
| Multi-tenant | product feature | **tenant isolation as a P0 invariant** — a cross-tenant read is a security bug the tests hunt for |

The improvement isn't a nicer inbox. It's a **different definition of "done"** — one that can't be faked by a stale ticket — enforced by code, not by a prompt.

## What it does

Kept maintains a human-verified, **event-sourced obligation ledger** for shared customer channels — capturing what your company owes each customer and the commitments your team makes back. One obligation's journey:

1. **Capture.** A customer message lands in a shared channel. Kept's LLM layer classifies and *proposes* a candidate obligation. Nothing is committed — it enters as `CANDIDATE`.
2. **Gate 1 — Confirm (human).** The owner gets a private card: what we think you committed to, prior commitments to this customer (pulled from the ledger), and a roadmap-conflict warning if the promised date beats the roadmap. Only on **Confirm** does it become `OPEN` — and *only then* does Kept create the Jira work item — a call that *code*, not the model, decides to make (live over Jira's REST API; the same client is MCP-capable, and the offline demo round-trips it over an in-process MCP server).
3. **Track & collect proof.** Ticket status, PR merges, and deploys arrive as webhooks. Then the agent **autonomously assembles Proof-of-Done** — it queries a feature flag's production state (LaunchDarkly over MCP) and a CI run's conclusion (GitHub Actions, live) — and proposes each as evidence.
4. **Reconcile — Proof-of-Done.** Ticket-Done alone is *never* enough. `assessFulfillment` resolves to exactly two sufficiency lanes: a merged PR **and** a production deploy, or a direct customer confirmation — and it refuses forged or non-production evidence. **The flag-OFF case blocks here.**
5. **Gate 2 — Verify (human).** When proof is sufficient, the owner gets a **verify card listing the Evidence Packet**. The agent did 95%; the human signs. Evidence opens the gate — it does not walk through it.
6. **Close the loop.** Kept drafts a **sanitized, leak-checked, customer-safe** closure, the owner approves (or edits) it, and it posts back into the **original thread**. The customer finally hears it's done.
7. **Outlive the ticket.** If the customer replies "still failing," the obligation `REOPENED`s — even if the ticket stays Done forever.

Ten lifecycle states, two mandatory human gates, one source of truth that lives in Slack.

**Reframing human-in-the-loop.** This isn't approval fatigue. The agent does the work — gathering, reconciling, drafting, sanitizing; the human only **signs the verdict** at two gates. *The agent does 95%; you sign.*

## How the integrations work together

![How Kept's integrations reconcile a single promise](https://kept-iota.vercel.app/assets/how-it-works.png)

No single source is "truth" — Kept **reconciles** them. Each integration answers a different question: **Slack** (*what was promised, and did the customer confirm?*), **Jira** (*is the ticket done?*), **GitHub Actions** (*did CI pass?*), your **deploy** pipeline (*released to prod?*), and **LaunchDarkly** (*is the feature actually switched ON for real users?*). Everything except Slack is **optional** — connect what you have; with none connected, the owner manually attests ("Mark delivered").

**One promise to Acme, end to end:**

1. **Slack** — a teammate says *"we'll ship the SSO fix by Friday."* You **Confirm** (Gate 1).
2. **Jira** flips to Done ✓ · **GitHub Actions** CI passes ✓ · the release **deploys** to prod ✓.
3. **LaunchDarkly** — Kept reads the flag in production: it's **OFF ✗**. The code shipped, but the feature is still switched off — Acme can't use it.
4. **Kept reconciles → BLOCKS.** Three signals say done, but the flag vetoes: *Ticket ✓ · CI ✓ · Deploy ✓ · **Flag OFF ✗** → not ready to close.* Verify is refused.
5. Someone **flips the flag ON** → Kept re-reads → all four agree → you **Verify** (Gate 2, a human signs).
6. **Slack** — a **sanitized** closure posts in the original Acme thread (no ticket, PR, or flag). Acme replies *"works now"* → the loop closes.

That step-4 block — one *negative* proof vetoing three *positive* ones — is the whole reason Kept exists.

## Two more reasons to keep it (the wow features)

- **Promise-drift radar.** "Next Tuesday" becomes "soon" becomes silence. Kept quantifies that decay — every live commitment gets a **drift score** (language softened, date slipped, scope moved, gone quiet, disputed) and surfaces the drifting ones in the App Home band and the Assistant's *"what's slipping?"* answer. Pure, deterministic, derived from the same event log; nothing is persisted.
- **Per-account customer trust page.** A private, audience-safe web page per customer — **Kept / in progress / verifying / at-risk** — that a CSM can share as a retention weapon. It runs through the **same D1 audience sanitizer** as the channel: a leaky commitment label collapses to "Commitment #N," and no ticket, PR, or flag ever appears. Mint it with `/kept trust <customer>`, revoke it with `/kept untrust`.

## The three qualifying technologies (all genuine)

1. **Slack AI Assistant.** A conversational Assistant pane over the ledger (*"what's overdue?", "what did we promise Acme this week?"*). The LLM only **routes the question into a fixed intent grammar**; deterministic code runs the read — the same LLM-proposes/code-decides discipline as the rest of Kept.
2. **Model Context Protocol (MCP).** Kept is a **deterministic MCP client** used two ways: to *create* work items (Jira / Linear-style) and to *gather proof* (feature-flag state, plus CI conclusion). The model never selects a tool — **code picks the tool and arguments**; the model interprets language only. The demo + tests run a real MCP client↔server round-trip against an in-process server; in production **the money proof source — LaunchDarkly flag state — runs over real hosted MCP** (`https://mcp.launchdarkly.com/mcp/launchdarkly`, its API access token used as the Bearer; verified live, `get-flag` → flag OFF). The same client is **MCP-capable for Jira work items**, but the live Jira integration runs over REST today (the hosted Atlassian MCP needs OAuth, and an API token can't be its Bearer). A token is all it takes to swap the simulated server for the live one.
3. **Real-Time Search API.** Kept's Assistant calls `assistant.search.context` for cross-channel context, using a **bot token + the event's `action_token`** and the **granular `search:read.public`** scope — never the blanket `search:read`, which is **banned in the Marketplace**. Results are ephemeral (a "related discussion lives in #…" note; the raw content is never read into the log). *Honest note:* Slack gates the Real-Time Search API to **directory-published apps**, so it lights up the moment Kept's Marketplace listing is approved; until then the retriever is **fault-isolated** — a `LedgerRtsRetriever` sources prior commitments from the ledger Kept already owns, so the app works with or without RTS enabled.

## Built for organizations (Marketplace shape)

- **Multi-workspace OAuth, HTTP mode.** Production runs **HTTP mode (no Socket Mode)** with `@slack/bolt` OAuth and a `PostgresInstallationStore` — per-tenant bot tokens fetched per event and for out-of-band sends (reminders, webhook-driven closures).
- **Tenant isolation is a P0 invariant.** Every read is scoped by `team_id` through two choke points; a fail-**closed** resolver refuses to derive a tenant from a malformed payload; a cross-tenant write throws `CrossTenantWriteError` before any side effect. There are dedicated tenant-isolation and write-isolation test suites — a cross-tenant read is treated as a security bug, not a bug report.
- **Minimal, granular scopes; no banned scopes.** The manifest declares exactly what the code uses, and every scope is granular.

## How we built it

Kept is TypeScript (ESM, Node 20+), four deterministic layers around a pure engine with a strict seam between language and state. The keystone: **the LLM proposes; code decides.**

**LLM-proposes / engine-decides.** An inbound message goes to `proposeFromMessage`, which classifies and extracts via **forced tool-use with Zod validation at the boundary** (default `claude-opus-4-8`). The model returns a *Proposal* — a candidate `Command` — and nothing else. It never writes an event or mutates state. Offline, a `MockLlmProvider` runs a heuristic against the same schemas, fully deterministic. The deterministic heart is `decide()`: a pure `(events, command, ctx) → Decision` with no I/O — envelope validation → idempotency → command-boundary leak/consistency checks → project state → zero-copy `assertNoRawContent` → reconciliation gate → `canApply`.

**Event sourcing.** State is never a mutable row — the ledger is an append-only log, and an obligation is a *pure fold* of it. A logic change is a *replay, not a migration*, and `projectAt` gives free time-travel for the audit view.

**Proof-of-Done reconciliation.** `assessFulfillment` first drops forged or mislabeled evidence (a `customer_reply` claiming to be from GitHub is rejected), then resolves to two sufficiency lanes. A staging deploy can't masquerade as production; a self-declared `customer_scoped` flag on a non-prod deploy is ignored; a customer denial blocks verification. **The feature-flag-OFF observation is what holds a "ticket Done" obligation out of the gate.**

**Zero-copy persistence.** No raw Slack body, prompt, model response, or retrieved text is ever persisted. `assertNoRawContent` runs name- and value-based scans before every append — forbidden keys, oversized strings, and *any* Unicode line terminator. Payloads carry IDs, permalinks, and short derived fields only.

**Gate-before-side-effect ordering.** The orchestrator dispatches the gate command *first* and only creates a work item or posts to the customer thread `if (status === "applied")`. A deduped race returns `suppressed`, not `applied`, so two concurrent Confirm clicks can never create two tickets — no locks.

**Substrate that upgrades by environment.** Set `DATABASE_URL` and the in-memory store becomes a real `PostgresEventStore` (transactional `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`); `REDIS_URL` moves reminders to BullMQ; `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` switches to real Claude; `JIRA_EMAIL` + `JIRA_API_TOKEN` read live Jira over REST (the client is MCP-capable via `ATLASSIAN_MCP_TOKEN` once OAuth is wired); `LAUNCHDARKLY_MCP_TOKEN` reads live flag state over LaunchDarkly's hosted MCP; `GITHUB_TOKEN` reads live GitHub Actions CI conclusions.

**Honesty framing (a credibility beat, invariant #7).** **Slack is the real, live surface.** **GitHub Actions is a genuine live proof source** (a real workflow-run `conclusion` fetched from the GitHub REST API). **Jira is live over REST** (Jira Cloud, `email:token` Basic auth — work-item creation + status proof); the same client is **MCP-capable**, but the hosted Atlassian MCP needs OAuth and an API token can't be its Bearer, so the live path is REST. **LaunchDarkly — the flag-OFF money proof source — is live over MCP**: the adapter reads flag state from LaunchDarkly's hosted MCP (`https://mcp.launchdarkly.com/mcp/launchdarkly`), with a LaunchDarkly API access token used as the Bearer (`LAUNCHDARKLY_MCP_TOKEN`), and a REST fallback. When those tokens are absent, everything degrades cleanly to an **in-process simulated MCP proof server with real API skeletons** — the same server the offline demo and hermetic tests run against. Postgres + Redis/BullMQ are real and exercised by the live integration suite. We never imply a certified live integration for a simulated one — the honesty *is* the credibility.

## Challenges we ran into

- **Keeping the LLM out of the decision path without making it useless.** The model returns a Zod-validated `Command`; a pure `decide()` is the only thing that can emit an event. Every new "agentic" feature — proof collection, the Assistant, drift — obeys the same seam.
- **Defining "done" without lying to the customer.** A merged PR *feels* like done. It isn't. Reconciliation became a small set of explicit, testable sufficiency lanes plus an explicit refusal to honor a `customer_scoped` flag on a non-production deploy — and the flag-OFF proof source that catches the false "done."
- **Multi-tenant safety as a property, not a hope.** Every read had to carry the acting `team_id`; we made the tenant resolver fail *closed* and turned a cross-tenant write into a thrown error checked before any side effect — then wrote suites that try to break it.
- **Zero-copy is sneakier than it looks.** Raw content leaks in through oversized strings and exotic Unicode line terminators; we scan names and values, cap lengths, and flag *every* Unicode line break — including on the new proof, trust-page, and RTS surfaces.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

- A genuinely **pure decision core** — `decide()` and `canApply()` do no I/O — which makes the guarantees testable and the engine replayable.
- **299 hermetic tests + a live integration suite.** The engine, the Slack AI Assistant router, a real MCP client↔server round-trip, the Proof-of-Done gate, tenant isolation, and the trust page all run in-memory and deterministic; the integration suite verifies real Postgres + Redis/BullMQ (self-skipping when a service env is absent).
- **9 adversarial rounds** — the latest a **multi-agent, workflow-driven** sweep that attacked each guarantee independently and found (then fixed, then locked with regression tests) two real gaps we'd missed: proof adapters silently falling back to the *operator's* credentials for another tenant, and an evidence row mislabelling a live read as a webhook push. Every finding across all rounds is now a permanent regression test.
- **A production-hardening pass that closed the gap between "demo" and "product":** gate cards lock after one click (idempotent — no double-verify, no duplicate customer post), webhook endpoints are authenticated (no forged proof), the hosted app never fabricates a work item (a ticket appears only when a real tracker is connected), proof credentials are **strictly per-tenant** (no installer ever reads through the operator's accounts), and evidence rows are labelled by provenance (*read live* vs *reported* vs *attested*).
- **Integrations are optional (Option A).** A team with no automated proof source can still drive the full loop: the owner **manually attests delivery** (a first-class `manual_delivery` signal), which is sufficient to verify — *unless a connected proof source contradicts it*, in which case the guardrail wins (a flag that's OFF still blocks a "marked delivered" promise). The customer identity is anchored to the **channel** (`/kept customer <name>`), not re-guessed from each message.
- **Proof-of-Done that actually blocks.** The flag-OFF case isn't a slide — `npm run demo` shows the engine refusing to verify with ticket Done + merge + deploy in hand, then flipping to green the instant the flag goes ON.
- **A clean transport-agnostic core and a polished Slack-native UX** — confirm/verify/closure cards, edit modals that re-run the leak check on submit, an App Home dashboard with the drift band, a slash-command ledger, and the customer trust page — every guarantee mapping to a specific guard in a specific file.

## What we learned

**Trust is an architecture, not a feature.** The most valuable thing an agent can do in a customer channel is *refuse to act* until the right conditions hold — and prove why.

- **Make the safety property structural, not procedural.** A guard table that *cannot* emit an event without `approved_by`, and a reconciler that *cannot* verify without reconciled proof, did more for trust than any accuracy number.
- **"Evidence, not truth" is the right default** — and Proof-of-Done is what makes it real. Treating ticket status as a signal to reconcile against *reality* (a flag, a deploy, a customer's own confirmation) is the difference between an autonomous agent that's safe in a customer channel and one that isn't.
- **Human-in-the-loop is a feature, not a tax — if the agent does the assembling.** "The agent does 95%; you sign" reframes approval from friction into a signature on work already done.
- **Adversarial self-review beats more feature work.** Every round against our own guarantees surfaced bugs no happy-path test would.

## What's next for Kept

- Bring Jira onto the hosted **Atlassian MCP** (it needs OAuth — an API token can't be its Bearer — so live Jira runs over REST today), and harden the live **LaunchDarkly MCP** connection with full OAuth token refresh + per-tenant credential storage, behind the same deterministic `query()` contract.
- Per-source webhook HMAC verification, replacing the shared-secret stand-in.
- Richer reconciliation lanes (CRM account context, changelog evidence) behind the same consistency checks, with per-team sufficiency policy.
- Enterprise Grid org-wide install, broader proactive drift nudges, and ledger analytics (time-to-fulfillment, at-risk forecasting) — all derivable from the existing event log.
